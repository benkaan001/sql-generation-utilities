# SQL Generation Utilities

This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate the generation of SQL code based on input lists or predefined templates. It includes examples for generating generic SQL file structures and platform-specific configuration SQL (e.g., for Databricks table optimization).

These scripts are adapted from real-world automation tasks, using anonymized sample data.
